It is January, 2014 and I am introduced to the world of technical writing. The task: helping the audience understand the value of innovative business to business technologies. The B2B technology market seems transformative:
* Spurred by cloud, technologies such as big data, cloud, Internet of things (IoT), data analytics, Business Intelligence, and data visualization are in the boom. 
* Blockchain and Machine Learning were gathering steam. 
* Enterprise technologies transforming to meet robust, agile, and high performance computing needs of competitive businesses. 
* Monolithic technology design does not cut it anymore.

  
Companies across the energy, banking and insurance, legal, media, and logistics, defense, and more are investing in such advanced technologies and they want to be heard. As a technical writer, I am tasked to be their voice. The mission: helping the B2B technology decision makers, my target audience, make the right technology choice to solve their business problems. 


Seven-and-a half years on, I loved, lived, and cherished the job of a technical writer.   


During this job, I developed stories with a natural narrative arc. A story would begin with a strong moot point and would steer the reader toward connected arguments illuminating on the various aspects of the business and how the technology in question would fill the gaps. The story not only helped the reader appreciate a technology solution but also understand how it would meet their business needs. 


## Crossing the fence 

Fast forward to today and I am a documentarian. As a technical documentation specialist, I continue to write about cloud-native and on premise technology solutions enabled with features such as data visualization, knowledge graph, machine learning, IoT, and web technologies--albeit with a different perspective. 
While the first seven-and-a-half years dealt with helping the B2B technology decision makers make the right choice, the last two-and-a-half years has been about documenting the working of those technologies as part of user help. 


## Documentation, My Perspective
>What a find! What a place to be in! What fun!   
I stand amazed at the very idea of documentation. 
While technical writing is fulfilling for me as a writer, technical documentation takes fun to a whole new level. In ways, technical documentation for me completes the meaning of life. No less!
Why? Documentation centers on capturing the action, capturing the truth. It is about communicating the truth to the readers to help them take better decisions. Summarily, it is about a record of truth that enables readers to act wisely and make their own life better.


Below is my observation about planning and execution when it comes to writing and documentation.  


| Topic      | Technical writing | Technical Documentation |
| ----------- | ----------- |--------------------|
| Defining target audience | learning about who the decision maker is and their day looks like at work   | learning about the unique user persona, role in the organization and their task |
| Understanding the unique needs of the target audience      | understanding their business problems and what keeps them awake at night   | Technical documentation -- understanding their job responsibilities of a job role and what tasks they execute and what are their key concerns in executing their tasks  |
| Learning about the gaps the product fills      | knowing how the product is projected in the market   | Working with the marketing team and attending leadership meetings to understand what problems they are trying to address for the customers |
| Planning content structure      | Cutting one big idea into smaller chunks and arranging them in a cohesive manner   | User task workflow |
| Transforming complex technologies into simple coherent ideas      | Hiding the complexity of the technology while surfacing the value it delivers that allow readers to solve their problems | Working with Technical Product Owners to understand the problems solved for the end user, what the feature is, why it is important, at what phase of the work it is applicable, and how it works |
| Surfacing the moot point      | Highlighting the unique pain point of the reader and the details around it   | Understanding the scope of documentation, defining the table of contents for a feature, going from high level benefits to the instruction level walkthrough |
| Making the promise      | Making the big promise and diving deep into the intricate details of it by providing evidence of how the promise would be fulfilled   | defining the table of contents for a feature, going from high level benefits to the instruction level walkthrough |
| Narrative arc      | Making sure the big ideas are divided smaller chunks and arranged into logical sequence   | Tracking the sequence of end user actions, the user persona involved, and actions to be performed |
| Fulfilling the promise    | Circling to complete the story and showing how the value looks like | Showing the screenshots of how the user will see the UI |
| Case study      | Before and after effect   | Demo using dummy data and providing screenshots |
| Conclusion      | Reiterating the moot point and ending with a futuristic roadmap   | Note/Warning/Attention/Appendix |
